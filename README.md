## Arduino Boards Manager — Use this new core

Do NOT use the old core board JSON. Please add the following Package Index URL to your Arduino IDE (Preferences → Additional Boards Manager URLs) or to your platform configuration:

https://regsens.com/package_py32_index.json

This is the new Arduino Core package index for PY32Duino and must be used instead of any previous/old board JSON files.

Example (Arduino IDE):
1. Open Arduino IDE → File → Preferences.
2. In "Additional Boards Manager URLs" paste:
   https://regsens.com/package_py32_index.json
3. Open Tools → Board → Boards Manager, search for "Arduino PY32" and install the PY32Duino core.
